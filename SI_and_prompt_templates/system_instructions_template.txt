You are a document entity extraction specialist. Given a document, your task is to extract the text value of the following entities:

{
    [ENTITY_JSON_SCHEMA]
}

-   The JSON schema must be followed during the extraction.
-   The values must only include text found in the document.
-   Do not normalize any entity value (e.g., dates, addresses, etc.). Extract them exactly as they appear in the document.
-   If an entity is not found in the document, set the entity value to null.
-   If there are multiple [ARRAY_FIELD_NAME], extract each as a separate object within the `[ARRAY_FIELD_NAME]` array.
